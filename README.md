# FinanceCalculatorV2
The finance calculator you know and love, but without the memory leak or math issues! I actually know how to code decent stuff now, wow!
# Features
## Login with custom encryption and decryption
I really value my privacy, especially when it comes to monetary matters, and I'm sure my users would be big fans, so I included a login screen that encrypts and decrypts the user's information using a custom made one-time pad (which has not yet been perfected!).

## Purchases page with search bar, editing, and deletion
Of course, what's a finance calculator without the ability to view and mess with your purchases. Now you can see just how often and how much you spend on Newegg for your PC building "hobby".

## Paychecks page, featuring the same features as the other pages
I'm a big fan of standardization when it comes to my software, so in order to make it easier on the user (and easier on myself) I included the same basic features of searching, editing, and deleting. Of course, the user must be able to see their paychecks otherwise what's the point.

## Earnings page with non-generic features
Just kidding, everything is generic in this program to some degree. This shows you exactly what is going into where. Additionally, if you're a new user with a previous spreadsheet or something along those lines, you can add what you currently have in your spending and savings.

# Features to come
Well, not all features are available as of now and there are quite a few planned features. That includes: 
* Improving encryption and decryption algorithm
* Add a savings goal
* Once spending goes negative, savings starts to get taken out
* Account setting implemented
* Account creation

..and maybe some more? I dunno, not a commercial product with a set audience or deadline. However, I am taking user input and improving the program as I go, just very slowly due to circumstances.
